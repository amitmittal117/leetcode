# Custom Mind Maps

This folder contains company-specific and topic-specific mind maps.

## How It Works

1. **Request format:** "Create mind map: [Name]" + list of questions
2. **If exists:** Questions are added to existing mind map
3. **If new:** A new mind map file is created

## Example Usage

> "Create mind map: Microsoft" + list of 10 questions
> Later: "Add to Microsoft mind map" + 5 more questions
