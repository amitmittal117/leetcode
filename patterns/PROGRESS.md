## Auto-Detection

Files with `# Pattern:` tag = processed.
```bash
findstr /S /M "# Pattern:" solutions\*.py    # Windows recursive
```

**Current count: 123 / 3056 files processed**

## Git Workflow

After each batch:
1. `git add .` - stage all changes
2. `git commit -m "Add structured comments to [X] files (batch N)"` - commit
3. **User reviews** - then `git push` when ready

---

## Custom Mind Maps

For company-specific or topic-specific question sets:

**To create/add to a mind map:**
> "Create mind map: [Name]" + list of questions  
> "Add to [Name] mind map" + more questions

**Location:** `patterns/mindmaps/[name].md`
